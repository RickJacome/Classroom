<p> Welcome to Homework 2. The first real homework. The objective of this homework is to get a handle of basics of kinematic motion (Calculus). Followed by 1D kinematic problems to be exposed to the basics of kinematic equations. Each question will have the units required <strong>[shown in brackets]</strong>. Some notes: On questions asking to round to the nearest hundred, if the answer is 0.70, input 0.7 into your answer. </p>
