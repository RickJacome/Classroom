							<p align = "justify"> Hello, here you will find one of the topics I enjoy the most: teaching.
								I always strive to offer good quality teaching to everyone who is interested in learning. Overall I have about 8 years of experience teaching as a tutor. This included peer to peer tutoring and up to full classrooms of 30 or more people. Officially, I am certified as a CRLA Level 2 tutor, which basically says I have experience in this area.</p>
								<h3>Motivation and Background</h3> <br>
								<p align = "justify">Basically, I started to tutor because my Chemistry teacher from high school offered me the position of assistant tutor after school. </p> 
								<h3>Classes I have tutored in:</h3> 
								<ul>
								<strong>Mathematics</strong><br>
								Algebra/Geometry/Trigonometry<br>
								Linear Algebra<br>
								Calculus 1,2,3<br>
								Differential Equations<br>
								<strong>Physics</strong><br>
								Basic Classical Mechanics<br>
								Basic Electromagnetism<br>
								<strong>Engineering</strong><br>
								Statics<br>
								Dynamics<br>
								Introduction to Solid/Fluid Mechanics<br>
								Control Systems<br>
								Introductory Thermodynamics <br>		
								</ul>
								Well, I will hopefully add more details about my teaching experiences or teaching methods I have as well.
